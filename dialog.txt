Your goal is to vanquish the incompetent
Prime Minister of Canada and to do so,
journey through Canada and face its local enemies.
The enemies are fish, angry farmers, polar bears,
angry townsfolk and the Prime Minister
So you think you can be a better
prime minister than me, eh?
Don't believe what people say. I am the best!
But to show I am the best, I will give you the
chance to be the Prime Minister!
Simply answer issues, and whoever gets the most
happiness out of the people win!
NOOO! NOOO! My job ... gone! 
Fine, have the job!
WAAAAAAAA!!!!
